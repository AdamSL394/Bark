# Bark

Bark! Voice what's going on around you on our location based social platform. Our login authentication is ran on the node package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport">Passport.</a> New users can create an account by entering a valid email, a password, a username and hitting signup. If there are any problems such as a non valid emial being entered, a field being left empty, or an email already being taken the user is notified on the page. Returning users can enter the same three fields and hit login to be validated. Once logged a user must allow the site to access their location in order to grab posts in the local area, otherwise the site will not function (in the future we would like to add a location selection functionality). From the home page users can view the latest posts from all categories or filter them by category as well as make posts and go to thier own profile page. Making posts is simple and straight forward, simply fill out the required fields and Bark! Visiting the profile page shows the user all of their posts from all locations and all categories. A future goal would be to allow users to visit other user profiles.
